Tired of trying thousand of tools to organize my life, and inspired in the
idea of ONE BIG TEXT FILE from Danny O'Brien, I decided that the world needed
yet another GTD tool. The "Almighty" part is a reference to the idea of having
all type of notes about your tasks in one single file.

The whole idea of this GTD implementation relies in some custom notation
marks, the Folding capabilities of VIM and its power to work quickly with
text. I wanted something portable to collect, edit, search and structure
lightning fast my notes.
