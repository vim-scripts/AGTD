Tired of trying thousand of tools to organize my life, and inspired in the
idea of ONE BIG TEXT FILE from Danny O'Brien, I decided that the world needed
yet another GTD tool. The "Almighty" part is a reference to the idea of having
all type of notes about your tasks in one single file.

The whole idea of this GTD implementation relies in some custom notation
marks, the Folding capabilities of VIM and its power to work quickly with
text. I wanted something portable to collect, edit, search and structure
lightning fast my notes. This is the result so far:

    * Organize project tree with notes, links and tasks
    * Move tasks from the project tree to the TODO list inserting project label
    * Neatly collect and display all tasks related with a project
    * Ease project tasks/notes finding
    * Build a calendar with all the dates in the text file

I strongly recommend the UTL script as a side companion. It will enhance your
notes allowing you to open different links with just a short keystroke.

This script is my idea of how GTD should be done with VIM. Any comments, bug
reports, patches, fixes and suggestions are welcome.

If you like it, please, rate it in the Vim website to let me know that out
there there are people who find this useful. Otherwise I will consider this
just an scrapbook to learn Vim scripting. 

Any comments in my webpage would be appreciated. There you can request wished features, report bugs or just tell me to go on and that you would like to see more versions:
